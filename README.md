Class project for data analysis of Kickstarter data
## Challenge
5.13.2020-uploaded compressed excel file + 2 .png files of charts.
Excel file contains 2 analysis scenarios.
Analysis 1 - "outcomes based on goals" - uses COUNTIFS to determine the number of failed, successful and canceled projects and sorts these totals by the project goals, grouping them in $5K intervals
analysis 2 - "outcomes base on start date" - uses a pivot table to qantify the number of theater projects that canceled, were succesful, or failed to reach goal based on the month launched on the kickstarter platform. note that this data includes "live" projects whose outcome is TBA at the present time.

# Kickstarter-Analysis
Class project for data analysis of Kickstarter data
uploaded compressed excel file + 2 .png files of charts
analysis 1 - "outcomes based on goals" - uses COUNTIFS to determine the number of failed, successful and canceled projects to parse data by funding ranges; chart illustrates
analysis 2 - "outcomes base on start date" - uses a pivot table to qantify the number of theater projects that canceled, were succesful, or failed to reach goal based on the month launched on the kickstarter platform. note that this data includes "live" projects whose outcome is TBA at the present time
